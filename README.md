# DirtyDiesel ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

Is diesel really dirtier than petrol?

This project investigates whether diesel vehicles emit significantly more COâ‚‚ per kilometer than petrol vehicles using statistical hypothesis testing on Canadian vehicle emissions data.

ðŸ“ˆ Whatâ€™s included:
- COâ‚‚ emissions comparison between diesel and petrol vehicles
- Welchâ€™s t-test to determine statistical significance
- Visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib
- Policy exploration: **Should the Delhi government ban diesel cars after 10 years?**

ðŸŽ¥ This analysis is featured in my [YouTube video](#) â€” watch to see the insights and code walkthrough.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels
- SciPy for statistical tests
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Canadian Vehicle Fuel Consumption dataset â€” includes fuel type, COâ‚‚ emissions (g/km), and engine data.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
To provide a data-driven answer to:
- "Are diesel vehicles significantly more polluting than petrol ones?"
- "Should diesel cars face early bans in polluted cities like Delhi?"
